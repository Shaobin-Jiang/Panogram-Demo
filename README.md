# Panogram Demo

Code repository for the online demo of the Chinese version of the panogram.

## Running Locally

The program needs a local server to function properly. One way to do this would be, using Windows as an example, running the following line of code:

```shell
python -m http.server
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and check it out.
